# Story 1.1: 專案初始化與 Monorepo 結構設定

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** 開發者,
**I want** 一個配置好的 Monorepo 儲存庫結構,
**so that** 我可以從專案一開始就確保一致的開發標準與環境。

## Acceptance Criteria
1. 使用 `npm workspaces` 或 `Turborepo` 初始化 Monorepo。
2. `apps` 資料夾內建立 `frontend` 和 `backend` 兩個應用程式目錄。
3. `packages` 資料夾內建立 `eslint-config-custom` 和 `tsconfig` 用於共享配置。
4. 根目錄建立 `README.md` 和基本的 Git 版控設定。

  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create root package.json with workspaces configuration
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Set up basic npm scripts for managing monorepo
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Initialize git repository with .gitignore

  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Create packages/tsconfig with shared TypeScript configuration
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Link shared configs to apps/frontend and apps/backend
- [x] Task 4: Create project documentation and version control setup (AC: 4)
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Create comprehensive README.md with project overview and setup instructions
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Configure .gitignore for Node.js, TypeScript, and common IDE files
  - [x] Subtask 4.3: Add .editorconfig for consistent code formatting
- [x] Task 5: Write unit tests to verify monorepo structure
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Test workspace resolution and dependency linking
  - [x] Subtask 5.2: Test shared configuration import functionality

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story of the project.

### Data Models
No specific guidance found in architecture docs

### API Specifications
No specific guidance found in architecture docs

### Component Specifications
No specific guidance found in architecture docs

### File Locations
Based on the PRD requirements and acceptance criteria:
- Root directory: Main monorepo configuration files
- `/apps/frontend/`: Frontend application directory
- `/apps/backend/`: Backend application directory
- `/packages/eslint-config-custom/`: Shared ESLint configuration
- `/packages/tsconfig/`: Shared TypeScript configuration

### Testing Requirements
No specific guidance found in architecture docs

### Technical Constraints
From PRD Technical Assumptions:
- Repository Structure: Monorepo [Source: PRD Section 4.1]
- Service Architecture: Serverless (無伺服器架構) - to be implemented in later stories [Source: PRD Section 4.2]
- Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration testing required [Source: PRD Section 4.3]

### Testing
No specific testing standards found in architecture docs. Based on PRD requirements, unit tests should be implemented to verify the monorepo structure and configuration.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid understanding of monorepo architecture with npm workspaces. The developer successfully created a well-structured foundation for the project with appropriate separation of concerns between apps and shared packages. The implementation is clean, follows best practices, and includes comprehensive testing.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: packages/eslint-config-custom/index.js
  - **Change**: Disabled linebreak-style rule and added additional code quality rules
  - **Why**: The linebreak-style rule can cause issues on Windows development environments
  - **How**: Added comma-dangle, no-trailing-spaces, and eol-last rules for better code consistency

- **File**: test/monorepo.test.js
  - **Change**: Added ANSI color codes and better error handling
  - **Why**: Improves test output readability and error handling
  - **How**: Color-coded pass/fail indicators and wrapped execution in try-catch

- **File**: package.json (root)
  - **Change**: Added test:structure script
  - **Why**: Allows running structure tests independently
  - **How**: Separated monorepo structure tests from workspace tests

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓] Well-structured code following Node.js best practices
- Project Structure: [✓] Correct monorepo structure with apps/ and packages/
- Testing Strategy: [✓] Unit tests implemented for structure verification
- All ACs Met: [✓] All acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Improved ESLint configuration for cross-platform compatibility
- [x] Enhanced test output with color coding for better readability
- [x] Added dedicated test script for structure verification
- [ ] Consider adding TypeScript to the root workspace for type safety
- [ ] Add husky for pre-commit hooks to enforce standards
- [ ] Document workspace-specific npm scripts in README

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The .gitignore properly excludes sensitive files and environment variables.

### Performance Considerations

No performance issues. The monorepo structure is optimized for efficient dependency management.

### Final Status

[✓ Approved - Ready for Done]

### Additional Notes

- The developer correctly identified that package-lock.json was created but not listed in the File List
- Excellent documentation in README.md with clear setup instructions
- Good use of .editorconfig for consistent formatting across the team
